The main difference between a convencional and a process awareness web application

_Convencional_: The processes are hidden as mainly implicit. The flow is entirely controlled by the web app.

_Process Awareness_: The processes become explicit. The flow is controlled by a process engine.

## Example

Let's take as example a web application that controls a travel plan. To keep simple, we are assuming a travel plan is build in three steps:

- Buy the air tickets
- Book a hotel
- Rent a car

In a convencional web application, the programmer has to develop the pages that allow the final user to execute each actions and he also has to implement the flow control directly in the source-code. An eventual change in the flow requires an adjust in the web application source-code.
