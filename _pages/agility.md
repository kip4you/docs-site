# Agility in Software Processes

In 2001, as a response to a community that demanded more flexible processes, a
group of 17 software development professionals met to discuss alternative software
development methodologies. Having a clear vision of the flexible, lightweight and team-oriented software
development approach, the 17 practitioners proposed the [Manifesto for Agile
Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) that summarized the fundamental
principles of the new approach:

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan"

Although triggering a new era in software development, the manifesto was not a pioneer in proposing an agile approach
for software development. Actually the history of agile approaches dates back
to 1957, when John von Neumann, Geral Weinberg, Bernie Dimsdale, and Herb
Jacobs were applying incremental development techniques for software that were
built in IBM and Motorola. Although not knowing how to classify the approach,
they were practicing, they realized clearly that it was different from the Waterfall
Model in many [ways](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2003/06/r6047/13rRUxBJhpL).
The main contribution
of the manifesto was packing a set of existing values and principles and creating
a philosophy that has come to be a universal and efficient new way to manage
software projects.

# How agile works

In traditional waterfall methods, the development approach follows a strict linear
order that typically involves the stages: requirement, design, implementation, verification,
and maintenance. The business requirements and the project scope are
defined at the beginning of the project and the subsequent phases are planned to
accommodate these requirements and scope. At the end of the project, the software
is delivered to the customers and stakeholders. With agile methodologies, on
the other hand, take an iterative approach and software development is conducted
through a number of smaller cycles (iterations or sprints). Each cycle is a mini process
development instance: it has a backlog and a set of orchestrated tasks
organized in stages such as: requirement, design, coding, testing, and deployment.
At the end of each development cycle, a potentially shippable piece of software
is delivered. Thus, with every iteration, new features are added to the product,
which results in the gradual project growth. Given the delivered features are validated
early in the development life cycle, the chances of delivering a potentially failed
product are lower.

# Agile Frameworks

There is no formal agreement on the meaning of the concept of “agile”. However,
it is common sense to denote as “agile” those software development processes
or methods that are shaped around the values and principles proposed in the
Manifesto for Agile Development. These methods include, but are not limited
to: XP , Scrum, Crystal Family, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method, Adaptive Software Development, and OpenUp.
According to the recent 14th State of Agile, ["Scrum and related variants are"](https://stateofagile.com/#ufh-i-615706098-14th-annual-state-of-agile-report/7027494) the most popular of these agile methodologies.

# Agility everywhere

It turns out the agility movement spread to other industries than just software development and nowadays being _Agile_ is a culture promoting and delivering good results at scale. In fact scaling agile initiatives such as [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), advocate the whole organization should embrace agile and lean practices.
