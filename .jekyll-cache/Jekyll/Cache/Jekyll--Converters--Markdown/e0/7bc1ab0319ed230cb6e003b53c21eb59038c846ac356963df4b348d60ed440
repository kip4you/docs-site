<p>Working with Tenants is one of the most important features of the KIP4You PAP. 
A Tenant represents a subgroup inside the process engine that is used to control basically two aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scope</li>
  <li>Variability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s consider that we have two or more departments inside a given organization and that each department should not see process elements from other departments (process instances and tasks).
In this scenarion, a tenant is a concept used to control the scope of each department.
So, in our platform we create a tenant to each department and so the visibility of the process objects (process instances and tasks) is controlled by tenant.</p>

<h2 id="variability">Variability</h2>

<p>Another motivation for this feature is related to variability. Imagine a scenario where two departments follow almost the same process but there is a variation between them. 
In that case, we can deploy two different processes that share forms and delegates but are in fact different.</p>

<h2 id="managing-tenants">Managing Tenants</h2>

<p>The platform has native CRUD features to manage tenants that can be accessed through the menu <em>Administration -&gt; Tenants</em>.</p>

<h2 id="managing-tenant-members">Managing Tenant Members</h2>

<p>This feature allows to manage the members of a given tenant.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create two process models that share the same identifier and components but that have a small variability.</li>
  <li>Create the forms and delegates for the processes</li>
  <li>Deploy the processes to different tenants</li>
  <li>Start process using different users to check the behaviour.</li>
</ul>
