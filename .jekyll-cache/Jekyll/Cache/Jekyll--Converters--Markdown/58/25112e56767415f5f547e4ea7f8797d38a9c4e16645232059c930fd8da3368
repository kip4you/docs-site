<p>Initially to create an Email, we need to configure our Camunda BPMN.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/email-connector/BPMNEmail.png" alt="Simple example of BPMN" /></p>

<p>In this case it is common to have a task before send the Email in our case we have the Assess Quotation task a User Task, that simply approve or disapprove a quotation. If the quotation is approved than it send the Email Approval Quotation and if it is not approved it send Email Disapproval Quotation.</p>
