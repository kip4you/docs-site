<p>Initially to create an Email, we need to configure our Camunda BPMN.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/email-connector/BPMNEmail.png" alt="Simple example of BPMN" /></p>

<p>In this case it is common to have a task before send the Email in our case we have the <strong>Assess Quotation</strong> task a User Task, that simply approve or disapprove a quotation. If the quotation is approved than it send the <strong>Email Approval Quotation</strong> and if it is not approved it send <strong>Email Disapproval Quotation</strong>.</p>
