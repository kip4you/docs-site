<p>Initially to create an Email, we need to configure our Camunda BPMN.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/email-connector/BPMNEmail.png" alt="Simple example of BPMN" /></p>

<p>In this case it is common to have a task before send the Email in our case we have the <strong>Assess Quotation</strong> task a User Task, that simply approve or disapprove a quotation. If the quotation is approved than it send the <strong>Email Approval Quotation</strong> and if it is not approved it send <strong>Email Disapproval Quotation</strong>.</p>

<p>To simplify this tutorial we’ll only do the Email Approval Quotation. CLicking in the send task we open a tab to configure, first we click in <strong>Implementation</strong> and set te Type to <strong>Delegate Expression</strong> and put in Delegate expression <strong>${akipEmailConnectorDelegate}</strong>, this delegate already exists as a compiled class when we generate the base project.</p>

<p>Still in the configuration of Email Approval Quotation we click in <strong>Field injections</strong> and click in <strong>Create a new list item</strong> (plus icon), we’ll add the Name <strong>akipEmailConnectorConfigName</strong>, Type <strong>String</strong> and then the Value that we put the name of the process dot the name of our task using <strong>CamelCase</strong>, in our case it will be <strong>QuotationProcess.EmailApprovalQuotation</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="2-project-generation">2. Project Generation</h2>

<p>Before we pass to the coding the Email task, we need first to install the AgileKIP Generator to execute the project using the jhipster blueprint, after this we need to create the metadata of the domain, entities and their relations. To create the project step by step it’s recommended to read the tutorial <a href="https://agilekip.github.io/pap-documentation/tutorials/generating-an-app" style="color: blue">here</a></p>
