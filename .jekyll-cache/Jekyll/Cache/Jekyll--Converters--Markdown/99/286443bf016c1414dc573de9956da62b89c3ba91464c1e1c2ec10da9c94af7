<p>Initially to create an Email, we need to configure our Camunda BPMN.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/email-connector/BPMNEmail.png" alt="Simple example of BPMN" /></p>

<p>In this case it is common to have a task before send the Email in our case we have the <strong>Assess Quotation</strong> task a User Task, that simply approve or disapprove a quotation. If the quotation is approved than it send the <strong>Email Approval Quotation</strong> and if it is not approved it send <strong>Email Disapproval Quotation</strong>.</p>

<p>To simplify this tutorial weâ€™ll only do the Email Approval Quotation. CLicking in the send task we open a tab to configure, first we click in <strong>Implementation</strong> and set te Type to <strong>Delegate Expression</strong> and put in Delegate expression <strong>${akipEmailConnectorDelegate}</strong>, this delegate already exists as a compiled class when we generate the base project.</p>

<p>Still in the configuration of Email Approval Quotation we click in <strong>Field injections</strong> and click in <strong>Create a new list item</strong> (plus icon), weâ€™ll add the Name <strong>akipEmailConnectorConfigName</strong>, Type String and than</p>
